    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl combine oil, salt, and pepper. Rub potato skins with oil mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake potatoes (do not wrap in foil) in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove potatoes from the oven and slice skin off of tops. 
                Scoop flesh into a large bowl, reserving intact skins. 
                Add cheese, egg, butter, and 1/2 of the green onions to potatoes. 
                Mash potatoes while gradually adding milk. 
                Spoon mixture into reserved skins and top with remaining onions and paprika.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
            </li>

        Tuna salad is somewhat of a guilty pleasure of mine, so this seemed nice!

            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            
        </ul> 
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Butter a medium baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
                Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
                Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat.
                Stir in onion, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
                Increase heat to medium-high and mix in mushrooms.
                Continue to cook and stir until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.
                Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan; whisk in flour until smooth.
                Gradually whisk in milk and cook until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
                Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tuna, peas, mushroom mixture, and cooked noodles.
                Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave until melted, about 10 seconds.
                Mix in bread crumbs until combined and sprinkle over casserole. 
                Top with Cheddar cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>   
    </p>
